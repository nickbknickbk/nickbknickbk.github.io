At 14:00 students set out to visit local houses and facilities and to interview local people, to feel the local Dong culture, and to look for inspiring local features and interesting cultural elements. Before dinner, Nick and Wei organized a meeting to share the findings and ideas. After, a schedule for the next day is worked out by the group. <a href = "http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIyOTE4OTk4Mw==&mid=2652587439&idx=1&sn=054a9e26bad22d1a4779695b79d4b1e4&scene=5&srcid=0802QHB0Pi9KixvC38ugPOo3#rd">More...</a></p>

The students researched with the workshop coordinators on the design of the Dong Music Box reflecting on cultural meanings, forms for the designs, interaction modality and the sounds we wanted to preserve and share from the local culture. Local materials as bamboo sticks, weaves of reeds leaves, baskets, drum towers architecture and its uses, local instruments, provided inspiration. We presented and shared our ideas using colored post-its on a board on the wall. After lunch the group went to Huangdu village to study the traditional culture and music, enjoying and recording several performances from local musicians playing together or showing instruments. <a href = "http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIyOTE4OTk4Mw==&mid=2652587449&idx=1&sn=897bf16d4d2525447c87fa5d87ff852d&scene=5&srcid=0802L9S4Wp89TimWsNvgrSMp#rd">More...</a></p>

The Lucky flowers are embellished with colorful threads, beams and feathers. We were welcome with enthusiasm and the women taught us how to make the lucky flowers; this might be really useful for the design project! <a href = "http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIyOTE4OTk4Mw==&mid=2652587457&idx=1&sn=7802007db34dc576ddfd3f6c7cf58f92&scene=5&srcid=0802ovKZwm5K7KYl3Dc1tFL2#rd">More...</a></p>

The shopkeepers greeted us warmly and helped us finding what we need. We spent lot of time in a shop that sells Dong clothing and silver, browsing the many colors of the delicate brocade.

Vic and Meng collected the materials and started the final design with villagers in Pingri Village. They recorded the interview and decided to use the stories of Lucky Box as sound elements. Lucia, Tina and Chris visited Huangdu with their design and did some interview and test with tourist in order to get more feedback on the graphic design and interaction design. Alessia settled down the music and started to make the music box more robust. <a href = "http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIyOTE4OTk4Mw==&mid=2652587492&idx=1&sn=5b598f1fdf4fd2e4e47bd067a65ae2d6&scene=5&srcid=0731leqAvomLIEGBmDcUA8hu#rd">More...</a></p>
